Bar Graphs {#CHAPTER_BAR_GRAPH}
==========

Bar graphs are perhaps the most commonly used kind of data visualization. They're typically used to display numeric values (on the y-axis), for different categories (on the x-axis). For example, a bar graph would be good for showing the prices of four different kinds of items. A bar graph generally wouldn't be as good for showing prices over time, where time is a continuous variable -- though it can be done, as we'll see in this chapter.

There's an important distinction you should be aware of when making bar graphs: sometimes the bar heights represent *counts* of cases in the data set, and sometimes they represent *values* in the data set. Keep this distinction in mind -- it can be a source of confusion since they have very different relationships to the data, but the same term is used for both of them. In this chapter I'll discuss this more, and present recipes for both types of bar graphs.


Making a Basic Bar Graph {#RECIPE_BAR_GRAPH_BASIC_BAR}
------------------------

### Problem

You have a data frame where one column represents the *x* position of each bar, and another column represents the vertical (y) height of each bar.

### Solution

Use `ggplot()` with `geom_bar(stat="identity")` and specify what variables you want on the x- and y-axes (Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-BAR-GRAPH-BASIC-BAR)):

```{r FIG-BAR-GRAPH-BASIC-BAR, fig.cap='Bar graph of values (with stat="identity") with a discrete x-axis'}
library(gcookbook) # For the data set
ggplot(pg_mean, aes(x = group, y = weight)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity")
```


### Discussion

When x is a continuous (or numeric) variable, the bars behave a little differently. Instead of having one bar at each actual x value, there is one bar at each possible x value between the minimum and the maximum, as in Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-BAR-GRAPH-BASIC-BAR-CONT). You can convert the continuous variable to a discrete variable by using `factor()`:


```{r FIG-BAR-GRAPH-BASIC-BAR-CONT, fig.show="hold", fig.cap='Left: bar graph of values (with stat="identity") with a continuous x-axis; right: with x variable converted to a factor (notice that the space for 6 is gone)', fig.width=3.5, fig.height=3.5}
# There's no entry for Time == 6
BOD

# Time is numeric (continuous)
str(BOD)

ggplot(BOD, aes(x = Time, y = demand)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity")

# Convert Time to a discrete (categorical) variable with factor()
ggplot(BOD, aes(x = factor(Time), y = demand)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity")
```

In these examples, the data has a column for x values and another for y values. If you instead want the height of the bars to represent the *count* of cases in each group, see
[section\_title](#RECIPE_BAR_GRAPH_COUNTS).

By default, bar graphs use a dark grey for the bars. To use a color fill, use `fill`. Also, by default, there is no outline around the fill. To add an outline, use `colour`. For
Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-BAR-GRAPH-BASIC-BAR-SINGLE-FILL), we use a light
blue fill and a black outline:

```{r FIG-BAR-GRAPH-BASIC-BAR-SINGLE-FILL, fig.cap="A single fill and outline color for all bars"}
ggplot(pg_mean, aes(x = group, y = weight)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "lightblue", colour = "black")
```

> **Note**
>
> In ggplot2, the default is to use the British spelling, colour, instead of the American spelling, color. Internally, American spellings are remapped to the British ones, so if you use the American spelling it will still work.

### See Also

If you want the height of the bars to represent the count of cases in each group, see [section\_title](#RECIPE_BAR_GRAPH_COUNTS).

To reorder the levels of a factor based on the values of another variable, see [???](#RECIPE_DATAPREP_FACTOR_REORDER_VALUE). To manually change the order of factor levels, see
[???](#RECIPE_DATAPREP_FACTOR_REORDER).

For more information about using colors, see [???](#CHAPTER_COLORS).


Grouping Bars Together {#RECIPE_BAR_GRAPH_GROUPED_BAR}
----------------------

### Problem

You want to group bars together by a second variable.

### Solution

Map a variable to fill, and use `geom_bar(position="dodge")`.

In this example we'll use the `cabbage_exp` data set, which has two categorical variables, `Cultivar` and `Date`, and one continuous variable, `Weight`:

```{r}
library(gcookbook) # For the data set
cabbage_exp
```

We'll map `Date` to the *x* position and map `Cultivar` to the fill color (Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-BAR-GRAPH-GROUPED-BAR)):

```{r FIG-BAR-GRAPH-GROUPED-BAR, fig.cap="Graph with grouped bars"}
ggplot(cabbage_exp, aes(x = Date, y = Weight, fill = Cultivar)) +
    geom_bar(position = "dodge", stat = "identity")
```

### Discussion

The most basic bar graphs have one categorical variable on the x-axis and one continuous variable on the y-axis. Sometimes you'll want to use another categorical variable to divide up the data, in addition to the variable on the x-axis. You can produce a grouped bar plot by mapping that variable to fill, which represents the fill color of the bars. You must also use `position="dodge"`, which tells the bars to "dodge" each other horizontally; if you don't, you'll end up with a stacked bar plot ([section\_title](#RECIPE_BAR_GRAPH_STACKED_BAR)).

As with variables mapped to the x-axis of a bar graph, variables that are mapped to the fill color of bars must be categorical rather than continuous variables.

To add a black outline, use `colour="black"` inside `geom_bar()`. To set the colors, you can use `scale_fill_brewer()` or `scale_fill_manual()`. In Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-BAR-GRAPH-GROUPED-BAR-OUTLINE) we'll use the `Pastel1` palette from `RColorBrewer`:

```{r FIG-BAR-GRAPH-GROUPED-BAR-OUTLINE, fig.cap="Grouped bars with black outline and a different color palette"}
ggplot(cabbage_exp, aes(x = Date, y = Weight, fill = Cultivar)) +
    geom_bar(position = "dodge", colour = "black", stat = "identity") +
    scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Pastel1")
```

Other aesthetics, such as `colour` (the color of the outlines of the bars) or `linestyle`, can also be used for grouping variables, but `fill` is probably what you'll want to use.

Note that if there are any missing combinations of the categorical variables, that bar will be missing, and the neighboring bars will expand to fill that space. If we remove the last row from our example data frame, we get Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-BAR-GRAPH-GROUPED-BAR-MISSING):

```{r FIG-BAR-GRAPH-GROUPED-BAR-MISSING, fig.cap="Graph with a missing bar—the other bar fills the space"}
ce <- cabbage_exp[1:5, ]
ce

ggplot(ce, aes(x = Date, y = Weight, fill = Cultivar)) +
    geom_bar(position = "dodge", colour = "black", stat = "identity") +
    scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Pastel1")
```



If your data has this issue, you can manually make an entry for the missing factor level combination with an `NA` for the *y* variable.

To reorder the levels of a factor based on the values of another variable, see [???](#RECIPE_DATAPREP_FACTOR_REORDER_VALUE).


Making a Bar Graph of Counts {#RECIPE_BAR_GRAPH_COUNTS}
----------------------------

### Problem

Your data has one row representing each case, and you want plot counts
of the cases.

### Solution

Use geom_bar() withoutmapping anything to y
(Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-BAR-GRAPH-COUNT)):

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=cut)) + geom_bar()
# Equivalent to using geom_bar(stat="bin")
```

![Bar graph of counts](figs/rgcb_0307.png)

### Discussion

The diamonds data set has 53,940 rows, each of which represents
information about one diamond:

diamonds
carat cut color clarity depth table price x y z 1 0.23 Ideal E SI2 61.5
55 326 3.95 3.98 2.43 2 0.21 Premium E SI1 59.8 61 326 3.89 3.84 2.31 3
0.23 Good E VS1 56.9 65 327 4.05 4.07 2.31 ... 53939 0.86 Premium H SI2
61.0 58 2757 6.15 6.12 3.74 53940 0.75 Ideal D SI2 62.2 55 2757 5.83
5.87 3.64
With geom_bar(), the default behavior is to use stat="bin",
which counts up the number of cases for each group (each *x* position,
in this example). In the graph we can see that there are about 23,000
cases with an ideal cut.

In this example, the variable on the x-axis is discrete. If we use a
continuous variable on the x-axis, we'll get a histogram, as shown
in Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-BAR-GRAPH-COUNT-CONTINUOUS):

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=carat)) + geom_bar()
```

![Bar graph of counts on a continuous axis, also known as a
histogram](figs/rgcb_0308.png)

It turns out that in this case, the result is the same as if we had used
geom_histogram() instead of geom_bar().

### See Also

If, instead of having ggplot() count up the number of rows in each
group, you have a column in your data frame representing the y values,
see [section\_title](#RECIPE_BAR_GRAPH_BASIC_BAR).

You could also get the same graphical output by calculating the counts
before sending the data to ggplot(). See
[???](#RECIPE_DATAPREP_SUMMARIZE) for more on summarizing data.

For more about histograms, see [???](#RECIPE_DISTRIBUTION_BASIC_HIST).

Using Colors in a Bar Graph {#RECIPE_BAR_GRAPH_COLORS}
---------------------------

### Problem

You want to use different colors for the bars in your graph.

### Solution

Map the appropriate variable to the fill aesthetic.

We'll use the uspopchange data set for this example. It contains the
percentage change in population for the US states from 2000 to 2010.
We'll take the top 10 fastest-growing states and graph their
percentage change. We'll also color the bars by region (Northeast,
South, North Central, or West).

First, we'll take the top 10 states:

library(gcookbook) \# For the data set upc &lt;- subset(uspopchange,
rank(Change)&gt;40) upc
State Abb Region Change Arizona AZ West 24.6 Colorado CO West 16.9
Florida FL South 17.6 Georgia GA South 18.3 Idaho ID West 21.1 Nevada NV
West 35.1 North Carolina NC South 18.5 South Carolina SC South 15.3
Texas TX South 20.6 Utah UT West 23.8
Now we can make the graph, mapping Region to fill
(Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-BAR-GRAPH-FILL)):

```{r}
ggplot(upc, aes(x=Abb, y=Change, fill=Region)) + geom_bar(stat="identity")
```

![A variable mapped to fill](figs/rgcb_0309.png)

### Discussion

The default colors aren't very appealing, so you may want to set
them, using scale_fill_brewer() or
scale_fill_manual(). With this example, we'll use
the latter, and we'll set the outline color of the bars to black,
with colour="black" (Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-BAR-GRAPH-FILL-MANUAL)). Note
that *setting* occurs outside of aes(), while *mapping* occurs within
aes():

```{r}
ggplot(upc, aes(x=reorder(Abb, Change), y=Change, fill=Region)) +
    geom_bar(stat="identity", colour="black") +
    scale_fill_manual(values=c("#669933", "#FFCC66")) +
    xlab("State")
```

![Graph with different colors, black outlines, and sorted by percentage
change](figs/rgcb_0310.png)

This example also uses the reorder() function, as in this particular
case it makes sense to sort the bars by their height, instead of in
alphabetical order.

### See Also

For more about using the reorder() function to reorder the levels of a
factor based on the values of another variable, see
[???](#RECIPE_DATAPREP_FACTOR_REORDER_VALUE).

For more information about using colors, see [???](#CHAPTER_COLORS).

Coloring Negative and Positive Bars Differently {#RECIPE_BAR_GRAPH_COLOR_NEG}
-----------------------------------------------

### Problem

You want to use different colors for negative and positive-valued bars.

### Solution

We'll use a subset of the climate data and create a new column
called pos, which indicates whether the value is positive or negative:

library(gcookbook) \# For the data set csub &lt;- subset(climate,
Source=="Berkeley" & Year &gt;= 1900) csub\$pos &lt;- csub\$Anomaly10y
&gt;= 0 csub
Source Year Anomaly1y Anomaly5y Anomaly10y Unc10y Berkeley 1900 NA NA
-0.171 0.108 FALSE Berkeley 1901 NA NA -0.162 0.109 FALSE Berkeley 1902
NA NA -0.177 0.108 FALSE ... Berkeley 2002 NA NA 0.856 0.028 TRUE
Berkeley 2003 NA NA 0.869 0.028 TRUE Berkeley 2004 NA NA 0.884 0.029
TRUE
Once we have the data, we can make the graph and map pos to the fill
color, as in Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-BAR-GRAPH-COLOR-NEG). Notice that we
use position="identity" with the bars. This will prevent a warning
message about stacking not being well defined for negative numbers:

```{r}
ggplot(csub, aes(x=Year, y=Anomaly10y, fill=pos)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", position="identity")
```

![Different colors for positive and negative values](figs/rgcb_0311.png)

### Discussion

There are a few problems with the first attempt. First, the colors are
probably the reverse of what we want: usually, blue means cold and red
means hot. Second, the legend is redundant and distracting.

We can change the colors with scale_fill_manual() and
remove the legend with guide=FALSE, as shown in
Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-BAR-GRAPH-COLOR-NEG2). We'll also add a thin
black outline around each of the bars by setting colour and specifying
size, which is the thickness of the outline, in millimeters:

```{r}
ggplot(csub, aes(x=Year, y=Anomaly10y, fill=pos)) +
    geom_bar(stat="identity", position="identity", colour="black", size=0.25) +
    scale_fill_manual(values=c("#CCEEFF", "#FFDDDD"), guide=FALSE)
```

![Graph with customized colors and no legend](figs/rgcb_0312.png)

[???](#RECIPE_COLORS_PALETTE_DISCRETE) and
[???](#RECIPE_COLORS_PALETTE_DISCRETE_MANUAL).

To hide the legend, see [???](#RECIPE_LEGEND_REMOVE).

Adjusting Bar Width and Spacing {#RECIPE_BAR_GRAPH_ADJUST_WIDTH}
-------------------------------

### Problem

You want to adjust the width of bars and the spacing between them.

### Solution

To make the bars narrower or wider, set width in geom_bar().
The default value is 0.9; larger values make the bars wider, and smaller
values make the bars narrower (Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-BAR-WIDTH)).

For example, for standard-width bars:

```{r}
library(gcookbook) # For the data set

ggplot(pg_mean, aes(x=group, y=weight)) + geom_bar(stat="identity")
```

For narrower bars:

```{r}
ggplot(pg_mean, aes(x=group, y=weight)) + geom_bar(stat="identity", width=0.5)
```

And for wider bars (these have the maximum width of 1):

```{r}
ggplot(pg_mean, aes(x=group, y=weight)) + geom_bar(stat="identity", width=1)
```

![Different bar widths](figs/rgcb_0313.png)

For grouped bars, the default is to have no space between bars within
each group. To add space between bars within a group, make width smaller
and set the value for position_dodge to be larger than width
(Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-BAR-WIDTH-DODGE)).

For a grouped bar graph with narrow bars:

```{r}
ggplot(cabbage_exp, aes(x=Date, y=Weight, fill=Cultivar)) +
    geom_bar(stat="identity", width=0.5, position="dodge")
```

And with some space between the bars:

```{r}
ggplot(cabbage_exp, aes(x=Date, y=Weight, fill=Cultivar)) +
    geom_bar(stat="identity", width=0.5, position=position_dodge(0.7))
```

![Left: bar graph with narrow grouped bars; right: with space between
the bars](figs/rgcb_0314.png)

The first graph used position="dodge", and the second graph used
position=position_dodge(). This is because position="dodge" is
simply shorthand for position=position_dodge() with the default
value of 0.9, but when we want to set a specific value, we need to use
the more verbose command.

### Discussion

The default value of width is 0.9, and the default value used for
position_dodge() is the same. To be more precise, the value of
width in position_dodge() is NULL, which tells ggplot2 to use
the same value as the width from geom_bar().

All of these will have the same result:

```{r}
geom_bar(position="dodge")
geom_bar(width=0.9, position=position_dodge())
geom_bar(position=position_dodge(0.9))
geom_bar(width=0.9, position=position_dodge(width=0.9))
```

The items on the x-axis have x values of 1, 2, 3, and so on, though you
typically don't refer to them by these numerical values. When you
use geom_bar(width=0.9), it makes each group take up a total
width of 0.9 on the x-axis. When you use
position_dodge(width=0.9), it spaces the bars so that the
*middle* of each bar is right where it would be if the bar width were
0.9 and the bars were touching. This is illustrated in
Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-BAR-WIDTH-DODGE-EXPLANATION). The two graphs both
have the same dodge width of 0.9, but while the top has a bar width of
0.9, the bottom has a bar width of 0.2. Despite the different bar
widths, the middles of the bars stay aligned.

![Same dodge width of 0.9, but different bar widths of 0.9 (top) and 0.2
(bottom)](figs/rgcb_0315.png)

If you make the entire graph wider or narrower, the bar dimensions will
scale proportionally. To see how this works, you can just resize the
window in which the graphs appear. For information about controlling
this when writing to a file, see [???](#CHAPTER_OUTPUT).

Making a Stacked Bar Graph {#RECIPE_BAR_GRAPH_STACKED_BAR}
--------------------------

### Problem

You want to make a stacked bar graph.

### Solution

Use geom_bar() and map a variable fill. This will put Date on
the x-axis and use Cultivar for the fill color, as shown in
Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-BAR-GRAPH-STACKED-BAR):

```{r}
library(gcookbook) # For the data set
ggplot(cabbage_exp, aes(x=Date, y=Weight, fill=Cultivar)) +
    geom_bar(stat="identity")
```

![Stacked bar graph](figs/rgcb_0316.png)

### Discussion

To understand how the graph is made, it's useful to see how the data
is structured. There are three levels of Date and two levels of
Cultivar, and for each combination there is a value for Weight:

cabbage\_exp
Cultivar Date Weight sd n se c39 d16 3.18 0.9566144 10 0.30250803 c39
d20 2.80 0.2788867 10 0.08819171 c39 d21 2.74 0.9834181 10 0.31098410
c52 d16 2.26 0.4452215 10 0.14079141 c52 d20 3.11 0.7908505 10
0.25008887 c52 d21 1.47 0.2110819 10 0.06674995
One problem with the default output is that the stacking order is the
opposite of the order of items in the legend. As shown in
Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-BAR-GRAPH-STACKED-BAR-REVLEVELS), you can reverse
the order of items in the legend by using guides() and specifying the
aesthetic for which the legend should be reversed. In this case,
it's the fill aesthetic:

```{r}
ggplot(cabbage_exp, aes(x=Date, y=Weight, fill=Cultivar)) +
    geom_bar(stat="identity") +
    guides(fill=guide_legend(reverse=TRUE))
```

![Stacked bar graph with reversed legend order](figs/rgcb_0317.png)

If you'd like to reverse the stacking order, as in
Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-BAR-GRAPH-STACKED-BAR-REVSTACK), specify
order=desc() in the aesthetic mapping:

```{r}
library(plyr) # Needed for desc()
ggplot(cabbage_exp, aes(x=Date, y=Weight, fill=Cultivar, order=desc(Cultivar))) +
    geom_bar(stat="identity")
```

![Stacked bar graph with reversed stacking order](figs/rgcb_0318.png)

It's also possible to modify the column of the data frame so that
the factor levels are in a different order (see
[???](#RECIPE_DATAPREP_FACTOR_REORDER)). Do this with care, since the
modified data could change the results of other analyses.

For a more polished graph, we'll keep the reversed legend order, use
scale_fill_brewer() to get a different color palette,
and use colour="black" to get a black outline
(Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-BAR-GRAPH-STACKED-BAR-COLORS)):

```{r}
ggplot(cabbage_exp, aes(x=Date, y=Weight, fill=Cultivar)) +
    geom_bar(stat="identity", colour="black") +
    guides(fill=guide_legend(reverse=TRUE)) +
    scale_fill_brewer(palette="Pastel1")
```

![Stacked bar graph with reversed legend, new palette, and black
outline](figs/rgcb_0319.png)

variable, see [???](#RECIPE_DATAPREP_FACTOR_REORDER_VALUE). To manually
change the order of factor levels, see
[???](#RECIPE_DATAPREP_FACTOR_REORDER).

Making a Proportional Stacked Bar Graph {#RECIPE_BAR_GRAPH_PROPORTIONAL_STACKED_BAR}
---------------------------------------

### Problem

You want to make a stacked bar graph that shows proportions (also called
a 100% stacked bar graph).

### Solution

First, scale the data to 100% within each stack. This can be done by
using ddply() from the plyr package, with transform(). Then plot the
resulting data, as shown in
Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-BAR-GRAPH-PROP-STACKED-BAR):

```{r}
library(gcookbook) # For the data set
library(plyr)
# Do a group-wise transform(), splitting on "Date"
ce <- ddply(cabbage_exp, "Date", transform,
            percent_weight = Weight / sum(Weight) * 100)

ggplot(ce, aes(x=Date, y=percent_weight, fill=Cultivar)) +
    geom_bar(stat="identity")
```

![Proportional stacked bar graph](figs/rgcb_0320.png)

### Discussion

To calculate the percentages within each Weight group, we used the
ddply() function. In the example here, the ddply() function splits the
input data frame, cabbage_exp, by the specified variable,
Weight, and applies a function, transform(), to each piece. (Any
remaining arguments in the ddply() call are passed along to the
function.)

This is what cabbage_exp looks like, and what the ddply() call
does to it:

cabbage\_exp
Cultivar Date Weight sd n se c39 d16 3.18 0.9566144 10 0.30250803 c39
d20 2.80 0.2788867 10 0.08819171 c39 d21 2.74 0.9834181 10 0.31098410
c52 d16 2.26 0.4452215 10 0.14079141 c52 d20 3.11 0.7908505 10
0.25008887 c52 d21 1.47 0.2110819 10 0.06674995
ce &lt;- ddply(cabbage\_exp, "Date", transform, percent\_weight = Weight
/ sum(Weight) \* 100)
Cultivar Date Weight sd n se percent\_weight c39 d16 3.18 0.9566144 10
0.30250803 58.45588 c52 d16 2.26 0.4452215 10 0.14079141 41.54412 c39
d20 2.80 0.2788867 10 0.08819171 47.37733 c52 d20 3.11 0.7908505 10
0.25008887 52.62267 c39 d21 2.74 0.9834181 10 0.31098410 65.08314 c52
d21 1.47 0.2110819 10 0.06674995 34.91686
Once the percentages are computed, making the graph is the same as with
a regular stacked bar graph.

As with regular stacked bar graphs, it makes sense to reverse the legend
order, change the color palette, and add an outline. This is shown in
(Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-BAR-GRAPH-PROP-STACKED-BAR-FINAL)):

```{r}
ggplot(ce, aes(x=Date, y=percent_weight, fill=Cultivar)) +
    geom_bar(stat="identity", colour="black") +
    guides(fill=guide_legend(reverse=TRUE)) +
    scale_fill_brewer(palette="Pastel1")
```

black outline](figs/rgcb_0321.png)

Adding Labels to a Bar Graph {#RECIPE_BAR_GRAPH_LABELS}
----------------------------

### Problem

You want to add labels to the bars in a bar graph.

### Solution

Add geom_text() toyour graph. It requires a mapping for x, y,
and the text itself. By setting vjust (the vertical justification), it
is possible to move the text above or below the tops of the bars, as
shown in Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-BAR-GRAPH-LABEL):

```{r}
library(gcookbook) # For the data set

# Below the top
ggplot(cabbage_exp, aes(x=interaction(Date, Cultivar), y=Weight)) +
    geom_bar(stat="identity") +
    geom_text(aes(label=Weight), vjust=1.5, colour="white")

# Above the top
ggplot(cabbage_exp, aes(x=interaction(Date, Cultivar), y=Weight)) +
    geom_bar(stat="identity") +
    geom_text(aes(label=Weight), vjust=-0.2)
```

![Left: labels under the tops of bars; right: labels above
bars](figs/rgcb_0322.png)

Notice that when the labels are placed atop the bars, they may be
clipped. To remedy this, see [???](#RECIPE_AXES_RANGE).

### Discussion

In Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-BAR-GRAPH-LABEL), the *y* coordinates of the
labels are centered at the top of each bar; by setting the vertical
justification (vjust), they appear below or above the bar tops. One
drawback of this is that when the label is above the top of the bar, it
can go off the top of the plotting area. To fix this, you can manually
set the *y* limits, or you can set the *y* positions of the text *above*
the bars and not change the vertical justification. One drawback to
changing the text's *y* position is that if you want to place the
text fully above or below the bar top, the value to add will depend on
the *y* range of the data; in contrast, changing vjust to a different
value will always move the text the same distance relative to the height
of the bar:

```{r}
# Adjust y limits to be a little higher
ggplot(cabbage_exp, aes(x=interaction(Date, Cultivar), y=Weight)) +
    geom_bar(stat="identity") +
    geom_text(aes(label=Weight), vjust=-0.2) +
    ylim(0, max(cabbage_exp$Weight) * 1.05)

# Map y positions slightly above bar top - y range of plot will auto-adjust
ggplot(cabbage_exp, aes(x=interaction(Date, Cultivar), y=Weight)) +
    geom_bar(stat="identity") +
    geom_text(aes(y=Weight+0.1, label=Weight))
```

For grouped bar graphs, you also need to specify
position=position_dodge() and give it a value for the dodging
width. The default dodge width is 0.9. Because the bars are narrower,
you might need to use size to specify a smaller font to make the labels
fit. The default value of size is 5, so we'll make it smaller by
using 3 (Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-BAR-LABEL-GROUPED)):

```{r}
ggplot(cabbage_exp, aes(x=Date, y=Weight, fill=Cultivar)) +
    geom_bar(stat="identity", position="dodge") +
    geom_text(aes(label=Weight), vjust=1.5, colour="white",
              position=position_dodge(.9), size=3)
```

Putting labels on stacked bar graphs requires finding the cumulative sum
for each stack. To do this, first make sure the data is sorted
properly—if it isn't, the cumulative sum might be calculated in the
wrong order. We'll use the arrange() function from the plyr package,
which automatically gets loaded with ggplot2:

```{r}
library(plyr)
# Sort by the day and sex columns
ce <- arrange(cabbage_exp, Date, Cultivar)
```

Once we make sure the data is sorted properly, we'll use ddply() to
chunk it into groups by Date, then calculate a cumulative sum of Weight
within each chunk:

\# Get the cumulative sum ce &lt;- ddply(ce, "Date", transform,
label\_y=cumsum(Weight)) ce
Cultivar Date Weight sd n se label\_y c39 d16 3.18 0.9566144 10
0.30250803 3.18 c52 d16 2.26 0.4452215 10 0.14079141 5.44 c39 d20 2.80
0.2788867 10 0.08819171 2.80 c52 d20 3.11 0.7908505 10 0.25008887 5.91
c39 d21 2.74 0.9834181 10 0.31098410 2.74 c52 d21 1.47 0.2110819 10
0.06674995 4.21
ggplot(ce, aes(x=Date, y=Weight, fill=Cultivar)) +
geom\_bar(stat="identity") + geom\_text(aes(y=label\_y, label=Weight),
vjust=1.5, colour="white")
The result is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-BAR-LABEL-STACKED).

![Labels on stacked bars](figs/rgcb_0324.png)

When using labels, changes to the stacking order are best done by
modifying the order of levels in the factor (see
[???](#RECIPE_DATAPREP_FACTOR_REORDER)) before taking the cumulative
sum. The other method of changing stacking order, by specifying breaks
in a scale, won't work properly, because the order of the cumulative
sum won't be the same as the stacking order.

To put the labels in the middle of each bar
(Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-BAR-LABEL-STACKED-MIDDLE)), there must be an
adjustment to the cumulative sum, and the *y* offset in
geom_bar() can be removed:

```{r}
ce <- arrange(cabbage_exp, Date, Cultivar)

# Calculate y position, placing it in the middle
ce <- ddply(ce, "Date", transform, label_y=cumsum(Weight)-0.5*Weight)

ggplot(ce, aes(x=Date, y=Weight, fill=Cultivar)) +
    geom_bar(stat="identity") +
    geom_text(aes(y=label_y, label=Weight), colour="white")
```

![Labels in the middle of stacked bars](figs/rgcb_0325.png)

For a more polished graph
(Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-BAR-LABEL-STACKED-FINAL)), we'll change the
legend order and colors, add labels in the middle with a smaller font
using size, add a "kg" using paste, and make sure there are
always two digits after the decimal point by using format:

```{r}
ggplot(ce, aes(x=Date, y=Weight, fill=Cultivar)) +
    geom_bar(stat="identity", colour="black") +
    geom_text(aes(y=label_y, label=paste(format(Weight, nsmall=2), "kg")),
              size=4) +
    guides(fill=guide_legend(reverse=TRUE)) +
    scale_fill_brewer(palette="Pastel1")
```

Making a Cleveland Dot Plot {#RECIPE_BAR_GRAPH_DOT_PLOT}
---------------------------

### Problem

You want to make a Cleveland dot plot.

### Solution

Cleveland dot plots are sometimes used instead of bar graphs because
they reduce visual clutter and are easier to read.

The simplest way to create a dot plot (as shown in
Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-BAR-GRAPH-DOTPLOT)) is to use
geom_point():

```{r}
library(gcookbook) # For the data set
tophit <- tophitters2001[1:25, ] # Take the top 25 from the tophitters data set

ggplot(tophit, aes(x=avg, y=name)) + geom_point()
```

![Basic dot plot](figs/rgcb_0327.png)

### Discussion

The tophitters2001 data set contains many columns, but we'll focus
on just three of them for this example:

tophit\[, c("name", "lg", "avg")\]
name lg avg Larry Walker NL 0.3501 Ichiro Suzuki AL 0.3497 Jason Giambi
AL 0.3423 ... Jeff Conine AL 0.3111 Derek Jeter AL 0.3111
In Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-BAR-GRAPH-DOTPLOT) the names are sorted
alphabetically, which isn't very useful in this graph. Dot plots are
often sorted by the value of the continuous variable on the horizontal
axis.

Although the rows of tophit happen to be sorted by avg, that doesn't
mean that the items will be ordered that way in the graph. By default,
the items on the given axis will be ordered however is appropriate for
the data type. name is a character vector, so it's ordered
alphabetically. If it were a factor, it would use the order defined in
the factor levels. In this case, we want name to be sorted by a
different variable, avg.

To do this, we can use reorder(name, avg), which takes the name column,
turns it into a factor, and sorts the factor levels by avg. To further
improve the appearance, we'll make the vertical grid lines go away
by using the theming system, and turn the horizontal grid lines into
dashed lines (Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-BAR-GRAPH-DOTPLOT-ORDERED)):

```{r}
ggplot(tophit, aes(x=avg, y=reorder(name, avg))) +
    geom_point(size=3) +                        # Use a larger dot
    theme_bw() +
    theme(panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
          panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank(),
          panel.grid.major.y = element_line(colour="grey60", linetype="dashed"))
```

![Dot plot, ordered by batting average](figs/rgcb_0328.png)

It's also possible to swap the axes so that the names go along the
x-axis and the values go along the y-axis, as shown in
Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-BAR-GRAPH-DOTPLOT-ORDERED-SWAP). We'll also
rotate the text labels by 60 degrees:

```{r}
ggplot(tophit, aes(x=reorder(name, avg), y=avg)) +
    geom_point(size=3) +                        # Use a larger dot
    theme_bw() +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=60, hjust=1),
          panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),
          panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank(),
          panel.grid.major.x = element_line(colour="grey60", linetype="dashed"))
```

![Dot plot with names on x-axis and values on
y-axis](figs/rgcb_0329.png)

It's also sometimes desirable to group the items by another
variable. In this case we'll use the factor lg, which has the levels
NL and AL, representing the National League and the American League.
This time we want to sort first by lg and then by avg. Unfortunately,
the reorder() function will only order factor levels by one other
variable; to order the factor levels by two variables, we must do it
manually:

```{r}
# Get the names, sorted first by lg, then by avg
nameorder <- tophit$name[order(tophit$lg, tophit$avg)]

# Turn name into a factor, with levels in the order of nameorder
tophit$name <- factor(tophit$name, levels=nameorder)
```

To make the graph (Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-BAR-GRAPH-DOTPLOT-ORDERED2)),
we'll also add a mapping of lg to the color of the points. Instead
of using grid lines that run all the way across, this time we'll
make the lines go only up to the points, by using
geom_segment(). Note that geom_segment() needs values
for x, y, xend, and yend:

```{r}
ggplot(tophit, aes(x=avg, y=name)) +
    geom_segment(aes(yend=name), xend=0, colour="grey50") +
    geom_point(size=3, aes(colour=lg)) +
    scale_colour_brewer(palette="Set1", limits=c("NL","AL")) +
    theme_bw() +
    theme(panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),   # No horizontal grid lines
          legend.position=c(1, 0.55),             # Put legend inside plot area
          legend.justification=c(1, 0.5))
```

Another way to separate the two groups is to use facets, as shown in
Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-BAR-GRAPH-DOTPLOT-ORDERED2-FACET). The order in
which the facets are displayed is different from the sorting order in
Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-BAR-GRAPH-DOTPLOT-ORDERED2); to change the display
order, you must change the order of factor levels in the lg variable:

```{r}
ggplot(tophit, aes(x=avg, y=name)) +
    geom_segment(aes(yend=name), xend=0, colour="grey50") +
    geom_point(size=3, aes(colour=lg)) +
    scale_colour_brewer(palette="Set1", limits=c("NL","AL"), guide=FALSE) +
    theme_bw() +
    theme(panel.grid.major.y = element_blank()) +
    facet_grid(lg ~ ., scales="free_y", space="free_y")
```
